# Standards for Future Project Tasks
These standards should make it easier for the evaluation process to be more automated in the future. 
A "task" is defined as an evaluation procedure that evaluates how an app predicts certain things. Each `*_eval` in this repository is a task. 
_This has been called "theme" as well._  

## When Writing the Evaluation Code
* use `requirements.txt` for standardization/future-automation of the module install path. (Or this could be handled in docker.)
  * There may be situations where multiple requirements are in the same directory for different pieces of code. 

* Use standard clams_eval_utils module:
  * This python module is yet to be implemented, however, part of it is present in [Clams_Utils Module](https://github.com/clamsproject/clams-utils).  
    * The goldretriever code is commonly accessed so: `from clams_utils.aapb import goldretriever` and `goldretriever.download_golds(<params>)`.  
  * **New Evaluations SHOULD use goldretriever where possible.** Tasks where golds data is not publicly accessible or are in a hidden repository due to copyright may differ. 
  * The module should also include preds/golds mapping/pairing code, downloading/staging/accessing mmif+gold information, and common metrics. 

* Explain/document run commands/configurations and required file locations / file types.  
  * Highly recommended to use a detailed CLI argument parser such as `argparse`. 
  * The use of the code and the ability to replicate posted results should be expected. 
  * Recommended to be explicit on what file types need to be in what locations. 

* Error Handling: 
  * Some basic error handling should be present.
  * The goal is to avoid unexpected errors on things such as basic sanity checks - eg, not outputting the same number of results as are inputted. 
    * (Other common errors are invalid file types, invalid file locations, invalid file contents.)
  * If there are common errors, such as with incorrect gold+preds inputted, document that they may occur. (This should be also documented in the readme.)
  * Be explicit with output about errors that arise. 
  

## Template for Reports 
See [`template_for_eval_reports.md`](/template_for_eval_reports.md).  

## Template for Eval Readmes
See [`template_for_eval_readmes.md`](/template_for_eval_readmes.md).

## Template for Result Files generated by an Evaluation
Results File Naming: results.txt should be named so it is clear what report it goes with / should be named similarly to the report.txt.
