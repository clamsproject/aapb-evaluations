# Template for Future Evaluation Task Readmes






## (Considerations - Not a section in the template / Delete)
(Delete this section when using as a template.)  
* should specify what files types expected and where to get them. specify if expected input is a github url or must be a physical location. 
    * Make this more explicit that this is different from clams apps behavior which expects only single files curled.    
* (The evaluate.py script should specify correct run instructions. If not, or for more public-facing needs, it can be also copied here along with reasonable instructions.)   
* If there are common errors, such as with incorrect gold+preds inputted, document that they may occur. (This could be also documented in the readme.)
